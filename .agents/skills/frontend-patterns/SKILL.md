# Frontend Patterns

React-specific conventions layered on top of `coding-standards`. This is the detailed playbook for components, hooks, and UI architecture. Not for Flutter/SwiftUI/native (use the relevant language-specific agent).

## When to Activate

- Designing new components or refactoring existing ones
- Reviewing React component code for hook correctness, render performance, or accessibility
- Building forms with validation and error handling
- Implementing state management (local, lifted, global store)
- Optimizing render performance (memo, callbacks, lazy loading)
- Establishing component composition patterns (compound, render props, slots)
- Setting up styling architecture (CSS modules, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS)

## Component Composition

### Composition Over Configuration

```tsx
// PASS: Composable, flexible
<Card>
  <Card.Header>
    <Card.Title>Orders</Card.Title>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>{children}</Card.Body>
  <Card.Footer>
    <Button onClick={onSave}>Save</Button>
  </Card.Footer>
</Card>

// FAIL: Prop explosion, rigid
<Card title="Orders" body={children} footerButton="Save" onFooterClick={onSave} />
```

Compound components via `React.Context` work well when 3+ sub-parts share state. For 1-2 sub-parts, just use children.

### Children as the API

```tsx
// PASS: Children describe what the parent renders
<DataTable rows={rows} columns={columns} getRowKey={r => r.id}>
  {(row) => <Row key={row.id} {...row} />}
</DataTable>

// FAIL: Parent decides the row shape
<DataTable rows={rows} columns={columns} renderRow={r => ({ id: r.id, name: r.name, ...r })} />
```

### Render Props and Slots

Use render props only when children cannot express the customization (rare). Prefer `children` and named props (`header`, `footer`, `empty`).

## Hooks

### Rules

- Call at the top level. Never inside conditions, loops, or callbacks.
- Custom hooks start with `use`. Lint rule: `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`.
- Dependency arrays must be exhaustive. Lint rule: `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`.

### Custom Hook Extraction

Extract a custom hook when:
- The same stateful logic appears in 2+ components.
- A component has 3+ `useState` / `useEffect` calls that are conceptually one thing.
- Side effects need to be testable in isolation.

```tsx
function useDebouncedValue<T>(value: T, delayMs: number): T {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value)
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), delayMs)
    return () => clearTimeout(id)
  }, [value, delayMs])
  return debounced
}
```

### useEffect Boundaries

`useEffect` is for synchronizing with an external system (network, DOM, subscription, timer). It is NOT for:
- Deriving values from props/state — compute during render.
- Responding to user events — use the event handler.
- Triggering data fetches on mount — use a data-fetching library or `useEffect` only when SSR-safe.

### Stable References

Pass stable references down to memoized children:

```tsx
// PASS: Stable callback
const handleClick = useCallback((id: string) => { ... }, [dependency])

// PASS: Stable object
const config = useMemo(() => ({ theme, locale }), [theme, locale])
```

Do not memoize everything. Memoize when the child is expensive AND the reference would otherwise change every render.

## State Management

### Local First

State should live at the lowest component that needs it. Lift only when:
- Two siblings need it.
- A deeply nested component needs it AND a parent does not.

### State Categories

| Type | Tool | When |
|------|------|------|
| Ephemeral UI | `useState` | Open/closed, focused, draft input |
| Form state | `react-hook-form` / `formik` | Multi-field, validation, dirty tracking |
| Server state | `tanstack-query` / `swr` | Fetched, cached, revalidated |
| Global client | `zustand` / `jotai` / context | Cross-tree, infrequent updates |
| URL state | `useSearchParams` | Filters, tabs, pagination, shareable links |

Never store server data in `useState` + `useEffect` — it duplicates what `tanstack-query` already handles (cache, dedup, refetch, retry, stale-while-revalidate).

### Reducers for Complex Local State

Use `useReducer` when state transitions have 3+ named actions, or when next state depends on previous.

## Forms

### Library or Hand-Rolled

For 1-2 fields with simple validation, native HTML + state is fine. For 3+ fields, conditional fields, async validation, multi-step, or file uploads, use `react-hook-form` + `zod`.

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
  acceptTerms: z.literal(true),
})

type FormData = z.infer<typeof schema>

const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<FormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
})
```

### Validation Timing

- Schema validation on submit (always).
- Field-level validation on blur (UX).
- Inline format hints on focus (rare; sometimes annoying).

## Rendering Performance

### Memoization Decision Tree

1. Is the child expensive to render? (large list, deep tree, complex computation)
2. Do its props change every render? (new object/array/function)
3. If yes to both, memoize the child (`React.memo`) and stabilize props (`useCallback`, `useMemo`).

If no, do not memoize — `useMemo` itself has cost.

### Lists

- Always provide a stable `key` (id, not index).
- Virtualize lists > 100 items (`@tanstack/react-virtual`).
- Avoid inline arrow functions as list item handlers — extract to a stable callback.

### Lazy Loading

```tsx
const HeavyChart = lazy(() => import('./HeavyChart'))

<Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}>
  {showChart && <HeavyChart data={data} />}
</Suspense>
```

### Bundle Size

- Route-level splitting is mandatory for non-trivial apps.
- Component-level splitting is for > 50KB components used conditionally.
- Check bundle with `rollup-plugin-visualizer` or `@next/bundle-analyzer`.

## Accessibility (Quick Checklist)

- All interactive elements are `<button>`, `<a>`, or have `role` + `tabIndex`.
- All form inputs have `<label htmlFor>` or wrap with label.
- All images have `alt` (empty `alt=""` for decorative).
- Color is not the only signal (icons, text, or shape too).
- Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys for menus/comboboxes).
- Focus is visible (`focus-visible:ring-2` or similar).
- Headings form a single h1 → h2 → h3 hierarchy.
- Live regions for async content (`aria-live="polite"` for status, `assertive` for errors).

## Styling Patterns

| Approach | When |
|----------|------|
| Tailwind | New project, small team, want fast iteration |
| CSS Modules | Existing CSS, want scoped styles without runtime cost |
| CSS-in-JS (vanilla-extract, styled-components) | Design system, dynamic styles, SSR |
| Inline styles | Dynamic computed values (rare) |

Avoid mixing 2+ approaches in the same codebase. Pick one as the default.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Prop drilling > 2 levels** — lift to context or a store.
- **useEffect for data fetching** — use `tanstack-query` / `swr` / framework loader.
- **Derived state in `useState`** — compute during render.
- **Massive `useEffect` with 10+ dependencies** — split into focused effects.
- **Direct DOM access for state** — use refs only for non-state (focus, scroll).
- **`index` as key** — breaks when list reorders, animates, or has stateful items.
- **Inline `style={{...}}` for theming** — use CSS variables or theme provider.
- **Ternary chains in JSX** — extract to named components or variables.
