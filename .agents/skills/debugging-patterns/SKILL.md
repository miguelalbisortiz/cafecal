# Debugging Patterns

The discipline of finding and fixing the cause of a problem, not just the symptom. Most debugging failures are process failures — jumping to "fix" before understanding, fixing the wrong thing, fixing the symptom not the cause.

This skill is the **workflow and techniques**. For *tooling* (specific debugger commands, profiler flags), see your stack's documentation. For *production incident response* (live systems, on-call), see `incident-responder`.

## When to Activate

- A bug report comes in (with or without repro)
- A test is flaky / intermittent
- Performance regression (latency, throughput, memory)
- A coredump or stacktrace needs interpretation
- A service is misbehaving in production but logs show nothing useful
- A user says "it works on my machine" or "it only fails sometimes"
- Reviewing someone else's debugging approach (PR or chat)
- Writing a postmortem after a resolved incident

## Do Not Activate For

- Pure TDD on greenfield code (no bug to find)
- Code review on non-bug code (use `code-reviewer` or stack reviewer)
- Performance optimization without first identifying the bottleneck (use `performance-optimizer` for that)

## Core Principles

1. **Reproduce first, fix second.** A bug you can't reproduce is a bug you can't verify is fixed. Spend the time to make it deterministic.
2. **Hypothesize before you change.** State your current best guess: "I think the bug is in X because Y." If your fix doesn't address the hypothesis, you're guessing.
3. **Change one thing at a time.** A "fix" that changes five things teaches you nothing when it works. Bisect, isolate, fix, verify.
4. **The cause is rarely where the symptom appears.** The user reports a UI error; the bug is in the API; the API bug is in the DB query; the DB query bug is in the migration. Trace up the stack.
5. **Trust nothing you haven't verified.** "It can't be X" is a hypothesis to test, not a fact. Especially true for "it can't be a race condition" (it can) and "the data must be valid" (it might not be).
6. **Document your investigation as you go.** Comments in the test that reproduces. Notes in the PR description. The next person debugging will thank you. Future you will too.
7. **The fix is for the root cause, not the symptom.** Adding `try/catch` around the crash makes the symptom go away. Understanding *why* it crashed prevents the next instance.

## The Diagnostic Workflow

Five phases, in order. Skipping phases wastes more time than following them.

### Phase 1: Reproduce

Goal: get the failure to happen on demand, ideally with a test or script.

- **Get the exact conditions**: which input, which user, which environment, which time.
- **Minimize the repro**: strip the input to the smallest case that still fails. This often reveals the cause.
- **Automate the repro**: a failing test, a script, a curl command. If the repro is "click this button after this dance", it's not stable enough.
- **Distinguish always-fails vs. sometimes-fails**: different bugs, different techniques. Always-fails is logic. Sometimes-fails is concurrency, state, or environment.

```bash
# Save the curl that reproduces
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cart": "abc123", "coupon": "EXPIRED"}' \
  | jq
```

```typescript
// Failing test that reproduces
test("checkout with expired coupon returns 400", async () => {
  const res = await checkout({ cart: "abc123", coupon: "EXPIRED" })
  expect(res.status).toBe(400) // currently returns 500
})
```

### Phase 2: Localize

Goal: narrow down the location (file, function, line) of the bug.

- **Read the stack trace from bottom to top**: the root cause is usually in the lowest frame, not the top.
- **Add strategic logging**: log entry to each suspect function with input + state. Run. See where reality diverges from expectation.
- **Bisect**: when the bug appeared in a regression, use `git bisect` to find the commit that introduced it.
- **Trace the data**: print the value of the suspect variable at each transformation. Where did it go wrong?

```bash
# Git bisect for "when did this start failing?"
git bisect start
git bisect bad                    # current commit is broken
git bisect good <commit-hash>     # this commit worked
# then for each commit git picks, mark good/bad
# when done: git bisect reset
```

For automated bisect (faster):

```bash
git bisect start HEAD <good-commit>
git bisect run npm test
```

Git runs the test on each commit, marks good/bad, finds the culprit.

### Phase 3: Hypothesize

Goal: have a *testable* explanation of *why* it fails.

- State the hypothesis explicitly: "I think `parseDate` returns null when the input is missing, because the regex doesn't match the empty string."
- Make it falsifiable: "If I add a console.log in `parseDate` with the empty input, I should see null returned. If I see undefined, my hypothesis is wrong."
- Multiple hypotheses: rank them by likelihood. Test the most likely first.

### Phase 4: Verify (the hypothesis is wrong, often)

Goal: confirm or kill the hypothesis.

- Add the observation (log, breakpoint, assertion) that would distinguish your hypothesis from alternatives.
- If the observation matches: hypothesis is likely correct. Move to fix.
- If it doesn't: kill the hypothesis, form a new one. Don't add a "fix" that papers over the gap.

**Common failure mode**: the first hypothesis feels right, so the engineer "fixes" without verifying. The fix doesn't actually address the cause, and the bug returns in a slightly different form.

### Phase 5: Fix at the root

Goal: change the *cause*, not the symptom.

- Apply the smallest change that addresses the cause.
- Add a regression test (this is non-negotiable — see `testing-patterns`).
- Run the full test suite to confirm no other paths broke.
- Commit with a message that explains the cause: `fix: handle null parseDate return in checkout validator (regression from #1234)`, not `fix: bug`.

## Logging Strategies

### What to log, where

| Layer | What to log | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Entry/exit of public API | Input params, return value, duration | Trace request flow |
| Inside loops | Iteration count, current item | Detect infinite loops, wrong data |
| Around I/O | Before and after, with size | Network/disk is usually where things break |
| On error | Full error + context that produced it | Reproducibility |
| State transitions | "old_state → new_state, reason" | Audit, debugging state machines |

What **not** to log:
- Passwords, tokens, session IDs (see `security-review` for PII patterns)
- Full request bodies in production (often contains PII; log specific fields)
- Inside tight loops (use sampling or "every Nth")

### Strategic placement

```typescript
// Bad: log at the top of every function, no signal
function processOrder(order) {
  console.log("processing order") // always
  // ... 50 lines ...
}

// Good: log at decision points
function processOrder(order) {
  logger.info("order received", { orderId: order.id, items: order.items.length })
  if (!validateInventory(order)) {
    logger.warn("inventory check failed", { orderId: order.id, missing: getMissingItems(order) })
    return { error: "OUT_OF_STOCK" }
  }
  // ...
  logger.info("order completed", { orderId: order.id, total: order.total, durationMs })
}
```

### Correlation IDs

For multi-service or multi-request flows, propagate a correlation ID through every log call. The `observability` skill covers the implementation; here, the debugging pattern:

```typescript
// Every log line in a request should include the correlationId
// Then to debug: filter logs by correlationId, see the entire flow
const correlationId = req.headers["x-correlation-id"] ?? crypto.randomUUID()
req.log = req.log.child({ correlationId })

// Or via async context (Node 16+ AsyncLocalStorage)
const als = new AsyncLocalStorage()
als.run({ correlationId }, () => next())
// logger picks up correlationId from als automatically
```

To debug a reported issue: get the correlationId from the user (or from a related record), filter all logs by it, replay the entire request.

## Interactive Debugging

### Breakpoint types

| Type | When to use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Line breakpoint** | Pause at a specific line | "What is `x` here?" |
| **Conditional breakpoint** | Pause only when condition is true | "Pause when `userId === 12345`" |
| **Logpoint** | Log a value without pausing | "Print `x` for every iteration without breaking" |
| **Data breakpoint** | Pause when a variable is written | "Who is setting `state.user = null`?" |
| **Exception breakpoint** | Pause on any thrown exception | "What threw?" |

### Watch expressions vs. hover

- **Hover**: quick value check, single point in time
- **Watch**: expression re-evaluated on every step, see how it changes
- **Conditional breakpoint**: pause only when watch matches, fewer stops

### Common debugger workflows

```typescript
// Node.js / VS Code launch.json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Debug Tests",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/vitest",
  "args": ["run", "--reporter=verbose"],
  "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
}
```

```python
# Python: pdb or ipdb
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # or breakpoint() in 3.7+

# In the trace:
# n = next line
# s = step into
# c = continue
# p x = print x
# pp x = pretty print
# l = list source around current line
# w = where (stack)
# u = up the stack
# d = down the stack
# q = quit
```

```go
// Go: delve (dlv)
dlv debug ./cmd/api --breakpoint=main.go:42 -- print-vars
// or in code: panic("inspect") at the point of interest
```

## Profiling

Profile before optimizing. Optimizing without profiling optimizes the wrong thing.

### CPU profiling

What takes time, in what proportion.

```bash
# Python: py-spy (no code changes, low overhead)
py-spy top --pid 12345           # live top-like view
py-spy record -o profile.svg -- python main.py  # flamegraph
py-spy dump --pid 12345          # textual stack samples

# Node.js: clinic.js
clinic doctor -- node server.js
clinic flame -- node server.js   # flamegraph
clinic bubbleprof -- node server.js  # I/O and async visualization

# Go: pprof
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30
# In pprof: top, list functionName, web (visualize), peek, focus=regex

# Rust: cargo flamegraph
cargo install flamegraph
cargo flamegraph --bin myapp
# or with perf directly
perf record -F 99 -p $(pgrep myapp) -g -- sleep 30
perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | flamegraph.pl > flame.svg

# Generic Linux: perf + FlameGraph
perf record -F 99 -ag -- <command>
```

How to read a flamegraph:
- **Width** = CPU time. Wide plateau = hotspot.
- **Y axis** = stack depth. Bottom = entry, top = leaf.
- **Color** = arbitrary (often by module). Look for wide plateaus at the top.
- **Don't optimize deep narrow stacks** — those aren't the bottleneck.

### Memory profiling

Find leaks (memory grows unbounded) and bloat (single allocations are huge).

```bash
# Node.js: heap snapshots
node --inspect-brk server.js
# In Chrome DevTools: Memory tab → Take heap snapshot
# Or programmatically:
const v8 = require("v8")
v8.writeHeapSnapshot(`/tmp/heap-${Date.now()}.heapsnapshot`)

# Python: memray
memray run -o output.bin python main.py
memray flamegraph output.bin
memray stats output.bin

# Go: pprof heap
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
# In pprof: top, list, alloc_space vs inuse_space

# Rust: heaptrack or dhat
heaptrack ./myapp
heaptrack_gui heaptrack.myapp.*.gz
# or use dhat via cargo-dhat for ad-hoc analysis
```

### I/O and lock profiling

For "feels slow but CPU is idle" problems.

```bash
# Linux: iostat, iotop, fatrace
iostat -xz 1        # per-disk utilization
iotop -o             # which processes are doing I/O
fatrace              # filesystem operation trace

# strace: trace syscalls
strace -p $(pgrep myapp) -e trace=network,read,write -c
strace -e trace=openat -p $(pgrep myapp)  # which files are being opened

# Application-level: log every DB query, every HTTP call
# Then: which query is called 1000 times? Which HTTP call to a slow service is sequential?
```

## Postmortem Patterns

After a resolved incident, document it. The postmortem is not blame; it's learning.

### Template (lightweight)

```markdown
# Postmortem: <title>

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: HH:MM (detection → resolution)
**Severity**: SEV-1 / SEV-2 / SEV-3
**Author**: <name>
**Status**: draft / reviewed

## Summary
One paragraph: what happened, who was affected, what the impact was.

## Timeline (UTC)
- HH:MM — <event>
- HH:MM — <event>
- HH:MM — <event>

## Root Cause
The actual technical cause. Not "human error" — dig deeper. What decision or condition led to the failure?

## Contributing Factors
What made the failure worse or harder to detect. Multiple usually.

## What Went Well
What worked during the incident (good detection, good runbook, good comms).

## What Went Poorly
What didn't work (slow detection, unclear runbook, no comms).

## Action Items
- [ ] <action> — owner, due date, type (prevent / detect / respond)
- [ ] <action> — owner, due date, type
```

### 5 Whys

Iteratively ask "why" until you reach a systemic cause, not a proximate one.

```
Problem: Service returned 500 to all requests for 12 minutes.
Why? The service couldn't connect to the database.
Why? The connection pool was exhausted.
Why? A new feature held connections open for the duration of a long operation.
Why? The long operation didn't have a timeout.
Why? The standard pattern for this operation (used elsewhere) didn't include a timeout, and code review didn't catch the new call.
→ Systemic cause: missing timeout pattern + insufficient code review of new DB call sites.
→ Action: add timeout middleware (prevent), add linter rule (detect), add runbook step (respond).
```

## Common Bug Categories

Quick reference for "what kind of bug is this" — directs your diagnostic approach.

| Category | Typical symptom | First place to look |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Off-by-one** | Loop misses first/last item, fence-post error | Loop bounds, `<` vs `<=`, slice ranges |
| **Null/undefined** | "Cannot read property of null" | Where the value is set, where it's assumed to exist |
| **Race condition** | Sometimes fails, more under load | Shared mutable state, no lock, async without await |
| **Deadlock** | Hang, threads/processes stuck | Lock order, lock-with-callback, missing release |
| **Integer overflow** | Negative where positive expected, wraparound | Math, especially in typed languages with fixed widths |
| **Timezone** | "It works in dev (UTC), fails in prod (EST)" | Date construction, ISO parsing, `new Date("2026-01-01")` is UTC, `new Date(2026, 0, 1)` is local |
| **Encoding** | Mojibake, "Ã©" instead of "é" | UTF-8 vs Latin-1, byte/string confusion, `b` vs `str` |
| **Floating point** | 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3, money calculations off | Use Decimal/BigInt for money, never float for currency |
| **Async / Promise** | Order of operations wrong, missing await | Promise chain, `forEach` vs `for...of` (latter awaits) |
| **Resource leak** | Memory grows, FDs exhaust over time | File handles, DB connections, listeners without removal |
| **Caching** | Stale data, weird "it works after refresh" | Cache invalidation, TTLs, write-through vs cache-aside |
| **Configuration** | Works in one env, fails in another | Env vars, feature flags, config files — diff them |
| **Migration** | Old data has unexpected shape, new code assumes new shape | Backfill, dual-write, expand-contract pattern |

## Quick-Reference Checklist

When investigating a bug:

- [ ] Can I reproduce it on demand? (failing test, script, or reliable manual repro)
- [ ] Have I narrowed it to a file/function? (logs, breakpoints, bisect)
- [ ] Have I stated a hypothesis explicitly? ("I think X because Y")
- [ ] Have I verified the hypothesis? (added observation that confirms or kills it)
- [ ] Am I fixing the root cause, not the symptom?
- [ ] Did I add a regression test that fails without the fix and passes with it?
- [ ] Did I run the full test suite after the fix?
- [ ] Did I document the investigation (commit message, PR description, comment)?
- [ ] (For production incidents) Is a postmortem filed with action items?
