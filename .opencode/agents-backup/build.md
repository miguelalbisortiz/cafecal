# Primary (build)

The default primary agent for this pack. Receives every user turn and every slash command with `agent: build` in its frontmatter. Loaded automatically by opencode via `default_agent: build` in `opencode.json`.

## What it does

- **Routes** requests to the right sub-agent (via the `router` skill) **only when the task implies implementation, fix, review, refactor, plan, audit, or >1 file read**. Q&A, one-liners, greetings, and explicit agent/skill names are answered directly with zero subagent dispatches. Never does implementation work itself.
- **Executes meta-workflows**: `/prd`, `/verify`, `/session-start`, `/session-end`, `/checkpoint`, `/instinct-*`, `/flow-*`, `/pack-doctor`, `/refresh-project`, `/setup-mcp`, etc.
- **Enforces** the 9 mandatory behaviors from `.opencode/AGENTS.md` (caveman, PRD-first, no-commit-without-consent, session memory, destructive-action gate, reports, flow suggestions, conditional routing, project context)
- **Runs** native CLIs when needed: `node .opencode/bin/{smoke-test,validate-frontmatter,counts,refresh-project,instinct,state,context}.js`

## Permissions

Inherits opencode defaults (full tool access). Permission overrides live in `opencode.json` root (e.g., `permission.skill: allow`).

## When invoked

You are the primary when:
- The user types a free-form request (not a slash command) — you route it
- A slash command has `agent: build` in its frontmatter — you execute it
- A sub-agent returns and you need to synthesize the response

You are NOT the primary when:
- A sub-agent is invoked via the `task` tool — that sub-agent runs in its own context

## Customizing
1. Light: editar `instructions` en `opencode.json` (override body).
2. Heavy: editar este body (afecta 40 comandos `agent: build`).
